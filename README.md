 Our fake news detection system for our CC0002 project

 For our project, we want to build a Chrome extension that can determine whether a news source is fake or true, using machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI). Before building the extension, we must build the model first.

First, we sourced our datasets: [ISOT Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets) and [WELFake](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification) from Kaggle. Then, we applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts to clean and process the written data into numerical forms understood by computers. Finally, we trained and tested a few machine learning models, to see which works best in classifying news:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayer Classifier
3. Passive Aggressive Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Neural Network Architecture
